# DemonSlayerGalleryandDescription

It is the first polished Java application that I've made and it consists of a gallery as well as descriptions of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba characters such as Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, Inosuke Hashibira, Zenitsu Agatsuma and Daki. I've used Java Swing and Java AWT in the source code.

The entire source code is written in Java and the code editor that I use is Visual Studio Code.

To run the app, run the Demon Slayer Characters Gallery and Description.jar executable.
